This project was created for young people and children about the human body. It consists of several chapters, the first one being about the **bloodstream**. In it, there are 3 levels, corresponding to 3 different cells:
- red blood cells
- white blood cells
- platelets

The function of each cell is told in an interactive and fun way to promote learning.

All art and development has been done by the team. From concepts, models, animations to logic.
